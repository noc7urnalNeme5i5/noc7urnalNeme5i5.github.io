            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Robbie McLain, and I am a junior at Miami University.  I am majoring in Interactive Media Studies, otherwise known as IMS, with the intention of becoming involved in the videogame industry.  My hope is to apply my skills as a writer, either of code or of stories.  At the moment I am working on developing my technical skills, especially coding, as that is something I have really enjoyed.  I am a member of various clubs on campus, especially those in the “League of Geeks”.  The clubs I put the most energy into are the MU Anime Club, and the Miami Electronic Gaming Association, or MEGA for short.  Anime club is fairly self-explanatory, it is where I gather with other anime fans to watch anime and discuss what is going on in the world of Japanese animation.  MEGA, the other club I attend meets in Armstrong to provide anyone who comes with the opportunity to play a wide variety of videogames with others in a social setting.  I also occasionally attend meetings of the Strategy Gaming club and the Smash club.  On this site I will talk about myself in more detail, such as what my hobbies are and what interesting places I’ve been.  I’ve put in a few pictures from various trips I have taken, both recent and not so recent.  </p>

            <h3>Why There is a Terminator Behind me</h3>
            <p>The picture next to this paragraph was taken at the Experience Music Project, or EMP, in Seattle, which I visited over the summer.  While originally a Jimi Hendrix museum, hence the “Experience” in the name, the museum was combined with a fantasy and science fiction museum.  The picture was taken in the science fiction section of the museum, in front of a Terminator prop.  The EMP is absolutely one of my favorite museums of all time.  Each of the exhibits: fantasy, science fiction, and horror, as well as a temporary Star Trek exhibit, is designed like a setting in that genre.  The science fiction section is set up to look like an ancient spacecraft, including flavor text at the entrance suggesting that it has been collecting artifacts for millennia, while the fantasy section is set up like a magical forest, complete with secret passages, dragons, and themed rooms for each of the exhibits.  The best part about the experience was the amount of interactivity that was built in to each exhibit.  I wish I could have visited as a kid.</p>

            <h3>Videogames</h3>
            <p>I am, and have been for most of my life, an avid fan of videogames.  I started out with a hand-me-down Gameboy color and Pokémon silver, a gift that sparked a lifetime of gaming.  These days I prefer to game on either my PC or my Xbox One, which is how I spend most of my free time.  While I will occasionally play multiplayer games like Overwatch or Destiny, I generally prefer single player games.  I have sunk literally hundreds of hours into Skyrim, which is one of my favorite games of all time.  I am also a huge fan of metroidvania style games, ever since I got the two Gameboy advance Metroid games as a kid.  While both Metroid and Castlevania seem to have been abandoned by their creators, I have enjoyed games that carry on their exploratory spirit.  One of the best examples of this is a series that I have recently gotten very deep into, which is the Dark Souls series.  The mix of challenging, skill based combat, and exploration of beautiful and desolate locations really hits the spot for me.</p>

            <h3>Anime</h3>
            <p>As I mentioned in my introduction, I am also a fan of anime.  I am a big fan of a variety of Japan’s cultural exports, which also includes videogames, but I am especially enthusiastic about anime.  While I consider myself more of a gamer than an Anime fan, I still love watching all the weird stuff that comes out of Japan.  I generally prefer shonen series, as they are usually fairly upbeat, and they were what I grew up with.  They also rarely slouch on the action and spectacle.  My favorite anime series include Bleach, Hellsing Ultimate, One Punch Man, Durarara, and Fairy Tail.  I have also recently come to enjoy the shows Is it Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, and My Hero Academia.</p>

            <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
            <p>When I’m not playing video games or watching anime, I also read a number of web-comics.  Among my favorites are Girl Genius, Paranatural, The Last Halloween, and the not-so-recently concluded epic, Homestuck.  I’ll include links to these comics at the bottom of the page, in an effort to spread the love.</p>
            <p>I am also the type to appreciate good food.  I am a big fan of eastern cooking styles, especially Japanese and Indian food.  I am also partial to Thai food.  While these types of food are not readily available on campus, I have found a few very good restaurants.  The lack of good Japanese cuisine in Oxford is disappointing, but at least I can get decent sushi at I Love Sushi.  However, good Indian food is not as hard to get here as you would think, the restaurant Krishna serves excellent Indian food, and is my favorite restaurant in the area.  I have their chicken makhani at least once a week, and there is something deeply satisfying about their fresh baked naan bread.

            <h3>Scotland</h3>
            <p>I have been all over the place thanks to a variety of vacations my family has taken.  My dad’s job came with a variety of conferences all over the place that gave him an excuse to drag the family to a number of interesting locations.  Among the places we visited when I was a lot younger, and quite a bit less inclined to remembering details, were Hawaii, Prince Edward Island, and Scotland.  That trip to Scotland is particularly interesting.  As my last name might suggest, I have Scottish ancestry, and when we went to Scotland, one of the main locations we were visiting was Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull.  This is significant because Duart Castle is the ancestral home of the Maclean clan, which is the family from which the surname McLain originated.  In other words, we were visiting our ancestral home, which is pretty neat.</p>

            <h3>Japan</h3>
            <p>One of the more recent trips I’ve been on was during my last year of high school.  My family went on a vacation to Japan.  If you’ve been paying attention, you should know why this was such an exciting trip for me.  Visiting Japan is one of my favorite trips I have ever been on.  We started in Tokyo, where we visited a number of interesting landmarks.  We checked out the ruins of Edo Castle in the middle of Tokyo, we also went up to Tokyo Skytree, a structure similar in concept to the Space Needle in Seattle.  My favorite part of the trip was when I got a chance to go check out Akihabara, the center of anime and videogame based entertainment and shopping in Tokyo.  However, one of the most enjoyable parts of the trip was all the wonderful Japanese food we ate.  I made a point of finding somewhere to get fresh ramen, and we also had the opportunity to eat shabu shabu.</p>
